This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Install pnpm

The package management system in use is pnpm. See instructions here: https://pnpm.io/installation

## Install dependencies

In a terminal at the root of the project (same directory where this file lives) Run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies

## Run the local dev server

In a terminal at the root of the project, ttart the development server with `pnpm dev`. The app should start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing

Tests live in the `__tests__` directory and are executed using Jest. Execute tests with `pnpm test`.

## Linting

The project is set up to use eslint with Prettier. Run `prettier --check <file name or path>` to check a file and `prettier --write <file name or path>` to reformat.

With VSCode, this can be done on save. Install the "Prettier - Code formatter" app. Then search for the setting `Editor: Format On Save` and enable it. Then search for the setting `Editor: Default formatter` and set to `Prettier - Code formatter`.

Please commit large reformatting changes separately from actual code changes. Please discuss with the team before changing any linting rules.
